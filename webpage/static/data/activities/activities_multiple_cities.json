On this visit, you will learn about the Jewish community and the Knights Templar; about the time when Marais was a fashionable neighborhood for opulent, yet restrained and elegant aristocratic abodes; when it fell from grace and was a working class, often dangerous place to be; how it was embellished, gentrified and how ultimately rose back to prominence. Not to leave anything out, you will also learn why it is one of most popular parts of the city for the Parisians too, not just for the tourists.",

Between the 15th and 16th centuries , under the orders of Charles VII, Louis XII and Francois I, the castle was refurnished. Its magnificent facade can be attributed to Charles VIII and Francois I, and their love for Italian art and style. It was because of this passion for Italian art that Francois I invited Leonardo Da Vinci to come and reside in Amboise as his first painter, architect and engineer. Da Vinci arrived in 1516 and spent the remaining three years of his life living and working in the nearby Chateau du Clos Luc\u00e9 (connected to the royal chateau by an underground passage). Leonardo Da Vinci died in Amboise and was buried in the Chapel of Saint-Hubert (on the ramparts of the Chateau d'Amboise). <br>Visit few wineries and enjoy a delightful 3-course lunch during this wonderful tour.",

The largest intervention of the joint Canadian, British and American forces, it was a massive debarquement on the beaches of Normandy, filled with German forces that were waiting for them. What ensued was a bloody and desperate battle where tens of thousands of lives were lost on both sides. This tour is not only a visit of the most important sites where these battles took place, but also the glimpse into a very complicated situation in the World War II and France\u2019s actual role and position in this war.",
